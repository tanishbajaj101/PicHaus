## Features

- **Collaborative albums** — invite collaborators or share an upload link; anyone with the link can upload without an account
- **EXIF metadata** — camera model, lens, focal length, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, date taken — extracted automatically on upload
- **Justified photo grid** — responsive masonry layout via Immich's WASM-accelerated justified-layout engine
- **Blurhash placeholders** — progressive image loading with smooth fade-in
- **Duplicate detection** — SHA-256 file hashing prevents uploading the same photo twice to the same album
- **Album cover cropper** — interactive 16:9 cropper with move, resize, rule-of-thirds guide, and live preview
- **Share links** — generate `view` or `upload` links per album, with optional password and expiry
- **Share groups** — bundle multiple albums under one share link
- **Branding and theming** — customize site name, accent color, logos, album/share-group headers, and upload-page messages
- **Instagram handles** — photographers can attach their Instagram username, shown on photos
- **User avatars** — upload a cropped profile photo
- **Favorites** — mark photos as favorites while browsing a share link; selections persist per album context and survive page refresh
- **Statistics dashboard** — top cameras, lenses, aperture/ISO/shutter distributions, monthly activity timeline
- **Username + password accounts** (this fork) — no email is ever collected; accounts are username and password only
- **Passkeys & security keys** — passwordless login via WebAuthn/FIDO2 (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, YubiKey, etc.)
- **External API** — scoped API tokens for integrating Gooncave with external sites or workflows
- **Fully self-hosted** — Docker image, PostgreSQL, local file storage

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.0
- PostgreSQL 14+

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ChokunPlayZ/Gooncave.git
cd Gooncave
bun install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL and AUTH_SECRET

# Start development server
bun dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. Database migrations run automatically on startup. On first visit you are redirected to `/setup` to create the admin account.

---

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t gooncave .

docker run -d \
  --name gooncave \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/gooncave" \
  -e AUTH_SECRET="your-random-32-char-secret-here" \
  -e STORAGE_DIR="/data/uploads" \
  -v gooncave-storage:/data/uploads \
  gooncave
```

> **Note**: `DATABASE_URL` is only needed at runtime — the build step has no database dependency.

### docker-compose example

```yaml
services:
  gooncave:
    image: gooncave
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://gooncave:secret@db:5432/gooncave
      AUTH_SECRET: replace-with-32-plus-char-random-string
      STORAGE_DIR: /data/uploads
      MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: "20"
    volumes:
      - uploads:/data/uploads
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: gooncave
      POSTGRES_USER: gooncave
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  uploads:
  pgdata:
```

| `STORAGE_DIR` | No | `storage/uploads` | Absolute or relative path where uploaded files are stored |
| `ASSET_DELIVERY` | No | `proxy` | Asset delivery mode: `proxy` streams through Gooncave; `redirect` sends clients to S3 after access checks |
| `S3_BUCKET` | When `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` | — | S3-compatible bucket name |
| `S3_REGION` | When `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` | `us-east-1` | S3 signing region |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | No | AWS S3 endpoint | Custom S3-compatible endpoint, e.g. MinIO or R2 |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | When `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` | — | S3 access key ID; `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is also accepted |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | When `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` | — | S3 secret access key; `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` is also accepted |
| `S3_SESSION_TOKEN` | No | — | Temporary credential session token; `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` is also accepted |
| `S3_PREFIX` | No | — | Optional object key prefix inside the bucket |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | No | endpoint-aware | Use path-style URLs; defaults to `true` with `S3_ENDPOINT` and `false` for AWS S3 |
| `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | No | — | Public bucket or CDN base URL used by `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect`; omit to use short-lived presigned URLs |

| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | No | `10` | Maximum upload size per file in megabytes |
| `AUTO_COMPRESS_LIMIT_MB` | No | `15` | File size in MB above which ANY uploaded image is compressed, regardless of origin/editing software |
| `FRESH_COMPRESS_LIMIT_MB` | No | `4` | File size in MB above which fresh-off-camera images (no editing software) are compressed |
| `AUTO_COMPRESS_FORCE` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to force auto-compression on all files, bypassing editing software detection |
| `AUTO_COMPRESS_RATIO_MB_PER_MP` | No | `0.5` | Ratio of file size (in MB) to image resolution (in Megapixels) above which JPEGs are compressed |
| `AUTO_COMPRESS_MAX_DIMENSION` | No | `4000` | Maximum width or height dimension (in pixels) to resize compressed images to |
| `AUTO_COMPRESS_QUALITY` | No | `88` | Compression quality for JPEGs/PNGs (1 to 100) |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` | Set to `production` in production deployments |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | No | `localhost` | Passkey relying-party ID — must match the domain users visit (no port, no protocol) |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` | No | `Gooncave` | Human-readable relying-party name shown by the browser during passkey registration |
| `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` | No | `http://localhost:3000` | Exact origin in the browser address bar — must include protocol and port if non-standard |
| `COMMUNITY_MODE` | No | `true` | This fork only. Set to `false` to restore upstream owner/collaborator-only behaviour. See [Community mode](#community-mode-this-fork). |

> **Security**: `AUTH_SECRET` must be a random string of at least 32 characters. In production the server will refuse to start without it.

> **Passkeys in production**: Set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` to your bare domain (e.g. `photos.example.com`), `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` to `https://photos.example.com`, and `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` to whatever label you want users to see in their authenticator. The three values must match exactly — mismatches cause silent passkey registration or login failures.

> **No email, ever (this fork)**: accounts are username and password only. Google and Microsoft OAuth sign-in were removed along with the `email` column they depended on — there is no code path anywhere that asks a user, admin, or share-link guest for an email address.

> **Auto-Compression and Resizing**:
> Gooncave automatically compresses and resizes uploaded photos to keep storage footprint and load times low, while preserving EXIF metadata on the saved files:
> - **Resizing**: Resizes files exceeding `AUTO_COMPRESS_MAX_DIMENSION` (default: `4000`px on the longest edge) using standard quality parameters (`AUTO_COMPRESS_QUALITY` default: `88`).
> - **Always-Compress Threshold**: Any uploaded image exceeding `AUTO_COMPRESS_LIMIT_MB` (default: `15`MB) is always compressed.
> - **Size-to-Resolution Ratio**: If a JPEG is larger than necessary for its actual resolution (Megapixels), it gets compressed. By default, if the ratio of file size (in MB) to image resolution (in Megapixels) exceeds `AUTO_COMPRESS_RATIO_MB_PER_MP` (default: `0.5` MB/MP), it is compressed. For example, a 12MP photo that is 9MB has a ratio of 0.75, which triggers compression.
> - **Fresh Camera vs Edited Photos**: Edited photos exported from software (e.g. Lightroom, Photoshop) are respected as-is, unless they exceed the always-compress threshold or the ratio check. Direct-from-camera photos without editor tags are compressed if they exceed `FRESH_COMPRESS_LIMIT_MB` (default: `4`MB) or 15 megapixels.

---

## Community mode (this fork)

This fork adds an opt-out "community mode" for small groups who want to share everything with each other, rather than keeping albums private by default.

- Every signed-in **member** — any account with a password, or the `ADMIN` role — can see, upload to, and download from **every** album, not just ones they own or were added to as a collaborator.
- Anyone can create albums (this was already true upstream).
- Anonymous guest accounts created by upload share links are **not** members, even if community mode is on. A share link still only unlocks the one album it points to.
- Album edit, album delete, cover photo, share links, collaborator management, and batch album edit remain **owner-only** — community mode only widens viewing, uploading, and downloading.
- On a shared album, members can still only delete photos they uploaded themselves; only the album owner or an admin can delete any photo.
- Deleting a user as an admin removes that user's contributions everywhere: their own albums (and the photos in them) plus every photo they uploaded in anyone else's album, including the files on disk.

Set `COMMUNITY_MODE="false"` in your environment to disable all of the above and restore upstream's owner/collaborator-only behaviour.

---

## First-Time Setup

1. Navigate to `http://your-host:3000` — you are automatically redirected to `/setup`
2. Enter a name, username, and password (minimum 8 characters) for the admin account
3. Click **Complete Setup** — you are redirected to `/login`
4. Sign in with the credentials you just created

The setup endpoint is permanently disabled once the first account exists.

## User Guide

### Albums

Albums are the primary organisational unit. Each album has a title, optional description, optional event date, tags, visibility (public/private), and an optional cover photo.

**Creating an album**

1. Go to **Albums** → click **Create Album**
2. Fill in the title and optional fields
3. Upload photos directly after creation

**Album views**

- **Grid** — card layout with cover photo thumbnails
- **Timeline** — albums grouped by event date (month/year)

**Searching and filtering**

The album list supports:
- Full-text search across title, description, and owner name
- Tag search (text input or click a tag chip)
- Combined tag + text filters

**Album permissions**

| Role | Can view | Can upload | Can edit metadata | Can manage share links |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Owner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Admin collaborator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Editor collaborator | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Viewer (share link) | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Upload link user | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |

**Cover photo**

Open an album → click the cover area → select any photo → crop using the 16:9 cropper:
- Drag inside the selection to **move** it
- Drag the **corner handles** to resize (ratio is locked)
- Use the live preview to verify the result before saving

**Album branding**

Album owners can set a theme preset, custom theme values, header logo text, or a logo image. These settings are used on the album page, public share views, and upload pages. Logos are uploaded once and can be reused across albums, share groups, and site branding.

**Batch operations**

In an album, enter selection mode (checkbox icon or long-press on mobile) to:
- **Click** a photo to toggle it; **Shift+click** to range-select from the last touched photo
- **Cmd/Ctrl+click** to toggle an individual photo without clearing the selection
- Delete selected photos
- Download selected photos as a ZIP

---

### Photos

The **Photos** page shows every photo across all your albums in a single justified grid with infinite scroll.

**Filtering**

- Camera model
- Lens
- Start date (by date taken)

**Photo viewer**

Click any photo to open the full-screen viewer:
- Navigate with arrow keys or swipe
- View EXIF data (camera, lens, focal length, ISO, aperture, shutter speed)
- Download the original file
- Share via the native share sheet (mobile)
- Adjacent photos are preloaded for smooth navigation

**EXIF metadata**

On upload, the following fields are extracted automatically from the file:
`cameraModel`, `lens`, `focalLength`, `iso`, `aperture`, `shutterSpeed`, `dateTaken`

These can be manually edited from the photo context menu (right-click or long-press).

---

### Share Links

Every album can have multiple share links. Links are accessed at `/v/<token>`.

**Types**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `view` | Read-only access — visitors can browse and download photos |
| `upload` | Visitors can upload photos to the album (creates a guest account) |

**Options**

- **Label** — a human-readable name for the link (e.g. "Club members")
- **Password** — optional; visitors must enter the password before accessing
- **Expiry date** — optional; link becomes invalid after this date
- **Show metadata** — toggle whether EXIF data is visible to share link visitors
- **Upload message** — optional note shown on upload links before photographers submit files

**Managing links**

Go to **Share Links** in the sidebar to see all links across all albums, with view counts, type badges, and expiry status. Links can be edited (label, expiry, password, metadata visibility) or deleted from this page.

---

### Share Groups

A share group bundles multiple albums under a single share link. Visitors who access the group link see a gallery of all albums in the group and can open individual albums from there.

**Creating a share group**

From an album's share link dialog, choose **Create Share Group** and add multiple albums. A single token is generated for the whole group.

Group share links support the same password and expiry options as individual album links.

Share groups can also have their own tags, theme, logo text, and logo image. Group branding is shown on the group share page and inherited by upload flows for group links.

---

### Favorites

While browsing a share link (`/v/<token>`), visitors can mark photos as favorites. Favorites are:

- Toggled by clicking the heart/star icon on any photo
- Persisted in `localStorage` keyed by token and album, so they survive a page refresh
- Context-aware — switching between albums in a share group saves and restores each album's favorites separately
- Stored locally in the browser only (not synced to the server)

---

### Guest Upload Flow

This is designed for photography club events: the club owner creates an **upload** share link, distributes it to photographers, and photographers upload directly without creating an account.

**From the photographer's perspective**

1. Open the share link URL (`/v/<token>`) and click **Upload Photos**
2. If password-protected, enter the password
3. Enter a display name and optionally an Instagram handle
4. Drag and drop photos onto the upload zone, or click to browse — a full-page overlay activates when files are dragged over the window
5. A per-file thumbnail queue appears showing each file's status: pending → hashing → uploading → done / duplicate / error
6. An overall progress bar tracks the batch; a summary (N uploaded · N duplicates skipped · N failed) appears on completion
7. Click **Add more** to queue additional files, **Clear all** to reset, or **Upload More Photos** to start a new batch

Uploads use resumable chunks. If the browser reconnects while the same file hash is still staged on the server, Gooncave resumes from the next expected byte instead of starting from zero. Chunk sessions are stored under `STORAGE_DIR/resumable` and are promoted to the configured storage backend after the final chunk is received.

**Account behaviour**

An upload link never asks for or collects an email address. Each visit creates a fresh anonymous guest account (name + optional Instagram handle only). If the photographer later wants a permanent account, they can sign up with a username and password from the **Create Account** option on the share link's identity step.

Uploaded photos are credited to the photographer's account and their Instagram handle (if provided) is shown on their photos.

---

### Statistics

The Statistics page (`/statistics`) shows aggregated data across all your albums:

- **Total photos** and **total albums** counters
- **Storage used**
- **Top cameras** — bar chart of the 5 most-used camera models by shot count
- **Top lenses** — same for lens models
- **Technical stats** — frequency tables for aperture, ISO, shutter speed, focal length
- **Activity timeline** — line chart of photos uploaded per month

---

### API Tokens

API tokens allow external services (personal websites, scripts, integrations) to query your albums and photos via the [External API](#external-api-reference).

**Creating a token**

1. Go to **API Keys** in the sidebar
2. Enter a token name (e.g. "My Portfolio Site")
3. Select the scopes you need (`photos:read`, `albums:read`)
4. Click **Create Token** — copy the token immediately, it is shown only once

**Scopes**

| Scope | Access |
|---|---|
| `albums:read` | List albums, get album detail |
| `photos:read` | List photos in an album, get random photos |

Tokens can be revoked at any time from the API Keys page.

---

### Settings

The **Settings** page lets each user update profile details, Instagram handle, theme preference, passkeys, and profile photo. Avatar uploads are cropped in the browser, saved as WebP, and shown on album, share, collaborator, and photographer views.

---

### Admin Panel

Accessible under `/admin/*` for accounts with the `ADMIN` role.

- **Users** — view all users, edit name/username/Instagram/role, promote or demote admins, impersonate a user for troubleshooting, merge duplicate accounts, and delete users
- **Invites** — create invite links and password-reset links, review usage, and revoke unused links
- **Settings** — configure site name, accent color, site logo, and public registration
- **Logos** — upload and delete reusable logo assets, with usage badges for site, album, and share-group references
- **Status** — inspect deployment health and configured services

The app prevents demoting the last remaining admin.

---

## Registration

Username/password login is always available for existing accounts. Public self-registration is controlled by **Admin** → **Settings** → **Allow public registration**. When disabled, new accounts can only be created via admin-issued invite links.

This fork never collects an email address anywhere — not at setup, registration, profile editing, or guest upload. There is no OAuth; Google and Microsoft sign-in were removed along with the `email` column they depended on.

---

## Invites and Password Resets

Admins can create invite tokens and password-reset tokens from `/admin/invites`.

- Invite tokens allow a new user to create an account even when public registration is disabled.
- Password-reset tokens are tied to an existing user and expire at the configured time.
- Tokens are single-use; once redeemed, `usedAt` is recorded and the token cannot be reused.

Invite links are opened at `/invite/<token>`.

---

## Branding

Gooncave branding is layered:

- **Site settings** control the global site name, accent color, and navbar/logo shown across the app.
- **Album settings** control the logo text/image and theme for that album's private page, public share page, and upload page.
- **Share group settings** control the logo text/image and theme for grouped public views.

Logo files are stored in the configured storage backend under `logos/` and served through `/api/assets/logo/<id>`.

---

## External API Reference

All external endpoints require:
```
Authorization: Bearer <api_token>
```

Responses are JSON with a top-level `success: true` field. Timestamps are Unix seconds (integers).

| `albumId` | UUID | Restrict to a single album |
| `tag` | string | Restrict to albums with this tag |
| `orientation` | `any` \| `landscape` \| `portrait` \| `square` | Default: `any` |
| `visibility` | `all` \| `public` \| `private` | Default: `all` |
| `fromDateTaken` | Unix timestamp | — |
| `toDateTaken` | Unix timestamp | — |

**Response** — same shape as the photo object in the albums/photos endpoint.

### Serving assets

Asset URLs returned by the API require an `Authorization` header **or** an `access_token` query parameter when the album is private.

```
GET /api/assets/thumb/<photo_id>     # WebP thumbnail (~400px)
GET /api/assets/full/<photo_id>      # Original file
```

For use in `<img>` tags, append `?access_token=<token>` since browsers cannot set custom headers:

```
/api/assets/full/<id>?access_token=<api_token>
```

---

## Authentication

Gooncave uses a custom HMAC-SHA256 token scheme rather than a JWT library.

**Format**: `base64url(payload) . HMAC-SHA256(payload, AUTH_SECRET)`

**Session tokens**

- Created on login (password, passkey, or guest upload flow), valid for 7 days
- Stored in `localStorage` under the key `gooncave_access_token`
- Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every API call
- For image asset URLs, appended as `?access_token=<token>`

**Passkeys and security keys**

Gooncave supports WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys and hardware security keys (YubiKey, etc.) as a passwordless login method via [@simplewebauthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev).

- **Sign in** — the login page has a **Sign in with Passkey** button. The browser or OS prompts the user to select a registered credential. No email or password is entered.
- **Register a passkey** — go to **Settings** → **Passkeys & Security Keys** → click **Add**. The browser prompts to create a new credential using the platform authenticator (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello) or a plugged-in hardware key. Multiple passkeys can be registered per account.
- **Manage passkeys** — each registered passkey is listed by name and transport (Built-in, USB, NFC, Bluetooth). Individual passkeys can be removed at any time.
- Passkey challenges expire after 5 minutes and are consumed on first use (replay-safe).
- Credentials are stored in the `passkeys` table as `credentialId`, `publicKey` (base64url), and a replay counter.

**API tokens**

- Prefixed `pk_` followed by 64 hex characters
- Stored as SHA-256 hashes in the database (never the raw token)
- Scoped: `photos:read` and/or `albums:read`
- Optional expiry; last-used timestamp updated asynchronously

**Password hashing**

All passwords (user accounts and share link passwords) are hashed with Argon2id:
- Memory cost: 19 MiB
- Time cost: 2 iterations
- Parallelism: 1

## Storage

Files are stored through the configured storage backend. By default Gooncave uses the local filesystem at `STORAGE_DIR` (default `storage/uploads`). Set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` to store photos, thumbnails, logos, and avatars in an S3-compatible bucket.

Asset delivery defaults to `ASSET_DELIVERY=proxy`, where browsers request Gooncave asset endpoints and Gooncave streams bytes from storage after enforcing auth/share-link checks. With `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect`, Gooncave still performs the same access checks, then returns a 302 to the bucket or CDN so the browser downloads the file directly.

**Storage backend choices**

| Backend | Configuration | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Local filesystem | `STORAGE_DRIVER=local` and `STORAGE_DIR=/path/to/uploads` | Small/self-hosted installs with a durable disk or Docker volume |
| S3-compatible bucket | `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` plus `S3_*` credentials | Larger libraries, object storage backups/lifecycle policies, multi-host deployments |

**Asset delivery choices**

| Delivery mode | Configuration | Browser receives | Bucket visibility | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proxy | `ASSET_DELIVERY=proxy` | Gooncave `/api/assets/...` response body | Private | Strongest control and simplest setup, but Gooncave pays bandwidth and handles streaming |
| Redirect with presigned URLs | `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect`, no `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Short-lived signed bucket URL | Private | Saves Gooncave bandwidth while preserving private objects; URLs remain valid until TTL expiry |
| Redirect to CDN/public base | `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect` and `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=...` | Public bucket/CDN URL | Public or CDN-authorized | Lowest Gooncave bandwidth and best CDN caching, but object access is controlled outside Gooncave after redirect |

**Local directory layout**

```
storage/uploads/
├── avatars/         # User avatars
├── logos/           # Site, album, and share group logos
├── photos/          # Original uploaded files + cover photos
├── resumable/       # Temporary resumable-upload sessions
└── thumbnails/      # WebP thumbnails (max 400×400)
```

**File naming**

`<first_16_chars_of_sha256>_<unix_ms>.<ext>`

Example: `a3f9c12d8e4b7f01_1743465600000.jpg`

**On upload**

1. MIME type verified by Sharp (not just the file extension)
2. SHA-256 hash computed for duplicate detection
3. EXIF data extracted
4. WebP thumbnail generated at ≤400×400
5. Blurhash generated at 32×32 for progressive loading
6. Both files written to the configured storage backend, then the database record is created
7. If the database write fails, both files are deleted (no orphans)

Cover photos are processed to JPEG at up to 2560×2560 and stored alongside regular photos.

**S3-compatible storage**

Set the bucket credentials and switch the driver. Gooncave signs S3 requests itself using SigV4, so no AWS SDK dependency is required.

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER="s3"
S3_BUCKET="gooncave"
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
S3_ENDPOINT="https://s3.example.com"
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
S3_PREFIX="production"
```

Stored object keys keep the same internal layout (`photos/...`, `thumbnails/...`, `logos/...`, `avatars/...`), optionally under `S3_PREFIX`. Existing local files are not migrated automatically. Resumable-upload chunks are still staged on the Gooncave server under `STORAGE_DIR/resumable` until each upload completes, then the final file is written to S3.

The access key must be able to:

- `PutObject` for uploads, thumbnails, logos, avatars, and health checks
- `GetObject` for proxy reads, image processing, rotations, cover crops, and presigned redirects
- `HeadObject` for asset existence and cache metadata
- `DeleteObject` for deleted photos/logos and health checks

For direct browser reads, keep the bucket private and omit `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to use short-lived presigned S3 URLs:

```env
ASSET_DELIVERY="redirect"
S3_PRESIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS="300"
```

The browser first requests `/api/assets/...`; Gooncave validates album ownership, collaborator access, API-token/share-link cookies, and public-album rules. Only after that check does Gooncave return a 302 to a presigned URL. The default TTL is 300 seconds and is clamped between 1 second and 7 days.

If objects are intentionally public behind a bucket website or CDN, set `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` instead:

```env
ASSET_DELIVERY="redirect"
S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://cdn.example.com/gooncave/"
```

When `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set, Gooncave maps internal object keys directly under that base URL. For example, with `S3_PREFIX=production` and `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cdn.example.com/gooncave/`, `photos/a.jpg` redirects to `https://cdn.example.com/gooncave/production/photos/a.jpg`.

**AWS S3 example**

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER="s3"
ASSET_DELIVERY="proxy"
S3_BUCKET="gooncave-prod"
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
S3_PREFIX="uploads"
```

For AWS S3, omit `S3_ENDPOINT`. Gooncave defaults to virtual-hosted-style URLs for AWS S3. Set `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect` to use presigned browser downloads.

**Cloudflare R2 example**

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER="s3"
ASSET_DELIVERY="redirect"
S3_BUCKET="gooncave"
S3_REGION="auto"
S3_ENDPOINT="https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE="true"
S3_PRESIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS="300"
```

R2 supports SigV4-style presigned URLs. Custom endpoints default to path-style URLs, but setting `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true` makes that explicit.

**MinIO example**

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER="s3"
ASSET_DELIVERY="proxy"
S3_BUCKET="gooncave"
S3_REGION="us-east-1"
S3_ENDPOINT="https://minio.example.com"
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE="true"
```

If you put MinIO behind a public reverse proxy or CDN and want direct reads, set `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect` and either use presigned URLs or set `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the public object URL prefix.

**Operational notes**

- Keep `ASSET_DELIVERY=proxy` if you need Gooncave to remain the only host clients contact for media.
- Use `ASSET_DELIVERY=redirect` to reduce Gooncave egress and CPU load for image downloads.
- Presigned redirects expose temporary object URLs to the user who passed Gooncave access checks. Use a short TTL if album membership or share-link access changes often.
- Public/CDN redirects do not make Gooncave re-check access after the redirect; configure bucket/CDN policies accordingly.
- Switching from local storage to S3 changes where new files are written. Copy existing `STORAGE_DIR` contents to matching S3 keys before switching a production instance.

## Database

Gooncave uses PostgreSQL via [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team). All timestamps are stored as Unix seconds (`BigInt`).

**Auto-migration on startup**

Migrations run automatically every time the server starts — no manual steps required when upgrading. The runner (a Nitro server plugin) applies any pending SQL files from `drizzle/migrations/` before the first request is served. Migration SQL is bundled into the production build so the `.output` directory is fully self-contained.

On first boot after upgrading from a Prisma-managed database, the runner detects the existing schema and stamps the migrations as already applied without re-running them — your data is untouched.

**Key tables**

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts — username, Argon2id password hash, name, Instagram, role |
| `logos` | Reusable logo assets for site branding, albums, and share groups |
| `albums` | Photo collection — title, description, tags, event date, visibility, cover photo |
| `photos` | Image file — storage paths, dimensions, blurhash, SHA-256 hash, full EXIF data |
| `share_links` | Token-based share link — type (view/upload), optional password, expiry, metadata flag, and upload message |
| `share_groups` | Bundles multiple albums under one share link, with optional theme and branding |
| `album_collaborators` | Per-album role assignment (viewer / editor / admin) |
| `api_tokens` | External API token — hashed, scoped, optional expiry |
| `passkeys` | WebAuthn/FIDO2 credentials for passwordless login |
| `invite_tokens` | Invite and password-reset tokens |
| `site_settings` | Global site branding and registration configuration |

**Schema changes**

Migration files live in `drizzle/migrations/`. To add a column or table:

1. Edit `server/db/schema.ts`
2. `bun run db:generate` — generates a new SQL migration file (requires `DATABASE_URL`)
3. Commit both the schema change and the generated SQL file
4. Deploy — the runner applies the new migration automatically on next boot

```bash
bun run db:generate   # generate migration SQL from schema changes
bun run db:migrate    # apply migrations manually (normally not needed)
bun run db:studio     # open Drizzle Studio to browse the database
```
